# LightMap
This software + hardware is designed to map lighting intensity in a serie of successive locations.

It uses a light dependant resistor to sense light level and a switch to trigger each measurement. 
The original goal was to measure light uniformity in an indoor seedling rack but can be useful for 
lighting devices designers, stage lighting, etc ...

See the LightMap.pdf file for user documentation.
